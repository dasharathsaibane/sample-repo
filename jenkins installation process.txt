 Follow the Below Steps to Install Jenkins in the VM:-

?If Jenkins is not installed in your system, then type the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
wget –q –O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add –
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

? Scroll to the bottom of the sources. list file and add the following lines:

         # Jenkins software repository
         deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary

Terminal:

     sudo apt update
             sudo apt install Jenkins
             sudo systemctl status jenkins     
             sudo ufw allow 8080
             sudo ufw status   

By default, Jenkins will run on port 8080. To start Jenkins type in the IP of your VPS and the port number 8080. It would look something like this in your browser – 120.0.0.1:8080.

You will be asked to enter the administrator password.
You can use the cat command to display the password:
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
